# WindTunnelTest

This repository contains software for the AE2130 - II Low Speed Wind Tunnel Test course at the TU Delft, taught in the second year of the Aerospace Engineering Bachelor.
The aim of this project is to compare experimental to computational wind tunnel data for 2D airfoils and 3D wings.

The IR folder contains code to obtain the average temperature picture for a given angle of attack at which the measurments were taken.
The 3D folder contains code to compare the experimental data (from a 6-axis balance) and computational data (XFLR5) for a 3D wing.
